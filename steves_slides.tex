\begin{block}{I don't know how to use git very well}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Trying to add a slide at the end.
	\item Merging this kind of file should be easy.
	\item Since it's blocks of code.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}{Steve also doesn't know latex / beamer very well}
\begin{itemize}
	\item But it should be easy to copy Roy.
	\item My slides will look like his then.
	\item Same = good.
