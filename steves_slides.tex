\begin{block}{New Mexico has an exceptionally high ratio of experienced researchers with advanced degrees}
\begin{itemize}
    \item These people have a lot of strong skills
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Math (Statistics, Linear Algebra, ...)
        \item Programming (Data preparation, analysis, viz)
        \item Using data to answer testable questions
        \item Curiosity to drive discovery and innovation
    \end{itemize}
    \item Currently it's extremely difficult to find discipline-specific research jobs
	\item "Data science" careers could or should grow and leverage the large talent base we have 
\end{itemize}
